# Milano-Vector-Fields
The purpose of this repository is to provide a sample of the code and the data needed to reproduce two sets of Vector Fields to depict origin destination (OD) movement data in Milano. The files included in this repository include a subset of the telecommunications and grid data, openly available at https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2015.55 and a python notebook which includes the data needed to be able to reproduce the work.  

The two sets of vector fields use `quiver` plot and to depict the location, direction, and strength of each of the flows. We use vector fields where the length of the arrows are proportional to:
1. distance between the OD
2. strength of flow between OD
